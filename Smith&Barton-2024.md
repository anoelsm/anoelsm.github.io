<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Phytoplankton species exhibit fundamental temperature niches that drive observed species distributions linked to realized temperature niches. A recent analysis of field observations of <i>Prochlorococcus</i> showed that for all ecotypes, the realized niche was, on average, colder and wider than the fundamental niche. Using a simple trait‚Äêbased metacommunity model that resolves fundamental temperature niches for a range of competing phytoplankton, we ask how dispersal and local temperature variability influence species distributions and diversity, and whether these processes help explain the observed discrepancies between fundamental and realized niches for Prochlorococcus. We find that, independently, both dispersal and temperature variability increase realized temperature niche widths and local diversity. The combined effects result in high diversity and realized temperature niches that are consistently wider than fundamental temperature niches. These results have broad implications for understanding the drivers of phytoplankton biogeography as well as for refining species distribution models used to project how climate change impacts phytoplankton distributions.</p>
