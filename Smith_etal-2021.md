<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Niche theory suggests that the realized niche occupied by an organism in the field is a subset of the fundamental niche space of the organism, absent additional biotic and abiotic factors. Though often assumed, this discrepancy is rarely tested for specific organisms, and could act as a source of error in model predictions of biogeographical shifts resulting from temperature change which assume niche theory constraints. Here, we quantify the difference between fundamental and realized temperature niches for four dominant ecotypes of <i>Prochlorococcus</i>, including eMED4, eMIT9312, eMIT9313, and eNATL2A, and ask whether the realized temperature niches of each ecotype vary across ocean basins. The realized niches for the four ecotypes are, on average, 3.84&#xb0;C&plusmn;1.18&#xb0;C colder (mean&plusmn;SD across all ocean basins and ecotypes) and 2.15&#xb0;C&plusmn;1.89&#xb0;C wider than the lab-measured fundamental niches. When divided into four ocean regions â€” North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, and South Pacific - we find that the realized temperature niche optimum for a given ecotype compared to the fundamental temperature niche optimum differs across regions by as much as 7.93&#xb0;C, while the niche width can differ by up to 9.48&#xb0;C. Colder and wider realized niches may be a result of the metabolic risk associated with living in variable environments when the mean temperature is too close to the optimal temperature for growth or due to physical processes such as dispersal. The strong differences in temperature niches across ocean basins suggest that unresolved genetic diversity within ecotypes, local adaptation, and variable interactive ecological and environmental factors are likely to be important in shaping <i>Prochlorococcus</i> realized temperature niches.</p>
